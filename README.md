MyApps
======

MyApps makes it easy to build desktop apps using Java Swing. It does the tasks like file handling, form validation, form creations, etc. It provides the support for the default and the custom GUI. All apps build using it are displayed at the main screen and collapsible sidebar. It is in very initial phase, you may find lots of quality issues with the code or many things incomplete. Be patient and if you are disappointed give us atleast a month.
